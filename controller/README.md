# The Rusty-PID Controller

This repository contains the code which is flashed onto the nrf52840 which acts as the espresso machine controller 
and performs all the important and time-critical functions (i.e. measuring and controlling the boiler temperature).

See the docs directory for more information on hardware used, pin configurations and how to flash.
